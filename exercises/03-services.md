## Exercise 3: Services

This week we're going to begin to use some computational infrastucture by signing up for various services that facilitate sharing, communication, versioning, archiving, manipulation, and the like.

This week:

1. Join [Github](https://github.com/) and become a member of this course's [organization](https://github.com/comp-methods-fsu-2021).
2. Begin to make a repository for your material. If you wish to make your repository private, share access with the instructor. Your repository should include the plain text files you will use as well as your index(es) (in .csv or .tsv format). Do not use Github for your image files (pdfs or jpgs).
3. Use the repository README to begin to do some documentation, log changes, and record a data dictionary. To do this, you will need to learn basic [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Many plain text editors (such as Atom) have a Markdown preview frame that you can use to check your work as you learn.
4. Download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which is a user friendly client to move code between your computer and Github's cloud repositories.
4. Join [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), which is a great place to ask your coding questions.
5. Join [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), which will give you a stable author identity that you can use throughout your academic life.
6. Join [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), which is an archiving service for publications and data. Join using (or link to) your Github and ORCID accounts.
7. Join [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Send your username to the instructor. Find a page or pages on your topic of interest. Make a few corrections. Consider how the pages are categorized.
8. Follow links to associated Wikidata items using the link in the Tools menu on the left hand side. Begin to explore the categories used to classify your topics in Wikidata. Try the basic [tour](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tours) to understand the organization of the portal.
