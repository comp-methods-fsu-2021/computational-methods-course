## Exercise 8: Website

Your deliverable this week is a website. This will be an evolving product. Below is a list of resources and approaches, in order of priority. Try to make it through this whole list eventually; not necessary to do it all this week.

### 1. Jekyll basics
Read and follow this tutorial: Amanda Visconti, "[Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages)," _Programming Historian_. It will give you a working github.io website.

### 2. Populate your website
- Make sure that your website links to your various ids (FSU, github, ORCID, etc)
- Transform some of your work from previous weeks into markdown pages and post them to your website. Start with a description of your chosen plain text source.

### 3. Experiment with themes
One of the virtues of the Jekyll and Hugo site generation method is its sustainability. You can change the theme of your website but maintain all of the content (its markdown files). Try out a different [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/) and see what works and what doesn't. Don't forget to look at your website on a mobile device as well as a pc web browser.

### 4. Experiment with Hugo and Netifly
Jekyll's main alternative is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which offers certain advantages (mostly in speed of transformation). It's easy to try out a hugo website with the same content you made for your Jekyll site; try their [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). Now, try Netifly (instead of localhost) to preview your website. The Hugo [Netifly guide](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/) is a good place to start, and you could also try the well-supported [Academic](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/) theme.

### 5. Consider collaborative websites
Visconti's introductory tutorial has a sequel: [Running a Collaborative Research Website and Blog with Jekyll and GitHub](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/collaborative-blog-with-jekyll-github). You will probably not currently be in a position to undertake work such as this, but if you skim the lesson you will gather ideas about how you can extend your website in future.
