## Exercises 11-15: Posting

At this point in the course, we are moving from general, common, prescriptive deliverables to particular, individual exercises. As a result, the format and content of your work each week will depend on your own scholarly character and profile. The requirements are largely defined by your own project. Because the work must be published on a public-facing website, its quality will be a function of your own contribution to the scholarly community, rather than your need to fulfil my idiosyncratic grading requirements.

In short, the only requirement is to post to your website some text files, some numbers, some explanation, and some visualization. That said, here are a few general suggestions that you may wish to explore in your work.

### Open formats
It will perhaps be most convenient to leave the plain text documents on github. On your website, post a link and descriptions of what readers will find there.

Your objective can be:
- to archive plain text that you use yourself
- to document the process that produced that text, for your own future reference
- to enable others to reproduce your work
- to enable others to do their own work using text you've prepared

Think about what kind of description and documentation will permit you and others to achieve these objectives. This will be the sort of writing that you can post (along with links to github repositories) on your website.

GitHub allows you to produce "[releases](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github)" of code and datasets. A release allows you to mark stages of completeness, and you may wish to do this now or in future. You might also want to use a license (such as a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)) specifying what sort of reuse you envisage. Your release can be posted to [Zenodo](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/), where it will receive a unique [Digital Object Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) (DOI). This is a good way to make your work available for citation by others.

Here's an example of some text I released and archived on Zenodo: [names-data](https://zenodo.org/record/4628299).
