## Exercise 9: Text Mining

The objective this week is mapping through basic mining. Most of your work will be text preparation. The analysis tools themselves ([Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/) and [TopicModelingTool](https://senderle.github.io/topic-modeling-tool/documentation/2017/01/06/quickstart.html)) are more or less plug-and-play.

### 1. Produce a folder of text files

Make at least a dozen plain files, each representing a single unit of text (for example, an essay or article or monograph). Give the file a distinctive name.

Voyant can be helpful in mapping a larger file that you might wish to break into smaller units.

### 2. Produce a metadata table

Each row of this single CSV file will describe a text file in the plain text folder you produced for step one. Include date, author, and any other metadata you may have.

### 3. Explore topic models

Install the Topic Modeling Tool according to its quick start guide. Run a few trials of topic models, using different numbers of topics. Find a set that seems to capture some pattern of variance between your texts.

### 4. Identify reference models

This is the most hard-to-pin-down aspect of the exercise. As Underwood makes clear, our topics do not make sense in the ether. They make sense in the context of models, received from our own scholarly traditions. Can you identify some of these models, in a format that you can operationalize?

### 5. Report

Write a brief blog-style description of your preliminary results, and post to your website.
