## Exercise 6: Visualization

This week, we will use data visualization tools to:
a) explore our data with an eye to eventual analysis
b) detect areas of the plain text corpus that need to be cleaned or improved

Use the tabular data file that you produced last week as a base. The aim at this point is to clarify the process you use to get tabular data from your plain text corpus, and to get visualizations from your tabular data. Conceive of the visualizations, the data, and the corpus as three distinct items.

## 1. Structure of your table
Paste your tabular data into [Breve](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/breve/), to see its formats and gaps. Breve suggests different markers (such as punctuation) that might allow you to further parse your columns. Consider what further parsing might achieve.

## 2. Tableau or Google Design Studio
You only need to try one of Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/overview)
or [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/), though each has its own virtues. Both of these visualization applications rely on connections with an external dataset. You can make changes to this dataset, and the visualizations will reflect those changes when refreshed. 

Make a link with your tabular data, and begin to see what datatypes the visualization software identifies. Most humanities projects will have a few different types: strings (i.e., of text), numbers, dates, and geolocations. Each of these will function differently in the visualization program. Make sure that the program is recognizing the format you intend.

Begin to experiment with visualizations. Get a handle on the most basic views, such as a bar graph with time on the X axis, before you experiment with more exotics views. There are a lot of variables and gadgets to play with. See what you can do to reproduce versions of the various visualization styles that Healy discusses.

## 3. Sharing visualizations
You can share interactive visualizations via Tableau Public or Google. Figure out the pipeline that connects your data file to your visualization experiments within the programs, and then to a shared online version of the visualization. It is this shared version that you will show us on Wednesday.

## 4. More exotic still
[Raw Graphs](https://app.rawgraphs.io/) extends your visualization possibilities in an web-based application. See if you can get something useful from it.
