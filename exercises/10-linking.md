## Exercise 10: Categorization

The objective this week is to discover the categorization schemes that structure Wikidata, the foremost repository of linked data relevant to the humanities.

You can begin to figure out Wikidata in (at least) two ways.

First, navigate to a Wikipedia page relevant to your research. In the lefthand menu, under "Tools", click on Wikidata item. This will bring you to the counterpart page. Familiarize yourself with the data it contains. In particular, consider the categories to which this item has been assigned. Click on the links the page contains to explore the structure of the data. Then, take the [Wikidata Item Tour](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q16943273&tour=wbitems&data=ok) to reinforce what you've seen. ([More tours here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tours).) Try looking at some of these pages using the alternate interface offered by the [Reasonator](https://reasonator.toolforge.org/).

Second, use the [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/). This service uses the SPARQL query language, but you will find it easier to use the visual editor, which you can access by clicking on the i on the top left. Try one of the listed examples, then change its terms to search topics of interest to you. Don't forget to press the blue play button to run your query. Click on the eyeball button above the results to try some visualizations. Once you've experimented a bit, read this [introduction](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/A_gentle_introduction_to_the_Wikidata_Query_Service) to reinforce and extend your understanding.

### 1. Get data from Wikidata

Now try to compose a useful query for your research. To do this, you are going to have to speak to Wikidata using terms it understands. One of the best ways to do this is to look at an item page that interests you, then adopt its terms in your searches.

For example, if you wished to compile a list of the birth dates of Wikidata persons born in Tallahassee, go [T-Pain's item](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q221155), then mimic the categories used there to structure your search.

Note, on the results page, that you can download results in .csv format. 

### 2. Give data to wikidata

Add at least one item of data to a Wikidata record relevant to your research.

### 3. Report

Write a brief blog-style description of your work with Wikidata, and post to your website.
