## Exercise 2: Corpus selection

Choose a corpus of texts that fits your research interests. This corpus will include a core text or texts (numbering in the hundreds of pages) that will be the focus of your intensive work, and a peripheral horizon of texts (numbering in the thousands of pages) that you will use to test the scalability of your work. For some students, this description will not fit your research needs; adapt in consultation with me.

This week:

1. Download images (pdfs or jpgs, for example) and raw plain text versions of each of the files. It is not necessary to clean the text at this point.
2. Make a spreadsheet of metadata for each of these files, including dates, volume or issue number, title, author, number of pages, and original URL.
3. Write a description of the characteristics of the corpus: what you hope to find in it for research purposes, the characteristics of the plain text, and any other pertinent considerations.
