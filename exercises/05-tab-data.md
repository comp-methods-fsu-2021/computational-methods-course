## Exercise 5: Tabular Data

At a minimum, this exercise requires rendering your source such that every line of plain text constitutes a row of a table. You can use OpenRefine to parse these rows into columns.

Describe the process by which you extract the necessary lines from your corpus, in such a way that this work can be reproduced if/when you revise your plain text corpus.
